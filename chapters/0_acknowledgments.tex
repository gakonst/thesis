\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my supervisor and professor Andreas Simeonidis for suggesting a thesis topic around Ethereum, along with Kyriakos Chatzidimitriou who both guided and supervised me throughout the creation of this thesis. 

This thesis would not have been possible without the guidance and support from Honda R\&D researcher Christian Koebel, with whom we worked together towards creating the proof of concept described in the thesis. Thank you, as well as the rest of Honda Research and Development Europe Germany for having me during the time period of our collaboration. Furthermore, I would like to thank the Trail of Bits team for sharing and letting me contribute to their auditing tool Slither.

I would like to thank my friends and my parents Athanasios and Eleftheria for their understanding, patience and feedback on the thesis.

Finally, I would like to thank Satoshi Nakamoto for creating Bitcoin.
