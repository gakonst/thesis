\section{Bottlenecks in Scalability}
Explain proof of work and how it limits transactions per second.
A variety of Scalability Solutions have been thought of such as Plasma, blabla, Ethermint?
We argue that there are two levels of scalability. Scalability on Contract and on Network Level. While the solutions described above are aiming at solving the Network level scalability, it is argued that scalability cna be also be improved by proper contract design, i.e better algorithm

\section{Network Level Scalability}
Long term solutions include. Due to the use case we will focus on shorter term solutions are shardign and casper pos
Shorter term solutions include payment channels, sidechains and alternative consensus algorithms. Due to the corporate setup, we choose to use proof of authority networks and further analyze them along with a minimal implementation of payment channels
