\section{Bottlenecks in Scalability}
Explain proof of work and how it limits transactions per second.
A variety of Scalability Solutions have been thought of such as Plasma, blabla, Ethermint?
We argue that there are two levels of scalability. Scalability on Contract and on Network Level. While the solutions described above are aiming at solving the Network level scalability, it is argued that scalability cna be also be improved by proper contract design, i.e better algorithm
