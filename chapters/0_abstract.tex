\chapter{Abstract}
We leverage the power of Smart Contracts to create a pilot energy use-case on Ethereum. We propose a suite of Smart Contracts which can be utilized to trustlessly store and verify the kilowatthour readings of an arbitrary number of `smart-meters' on the Ethereum network, while also applying accounting computations in order to properly bill that energy to the corresponding deparments of a company structure. Finally, contributions towards smart contract security and scalability are made.
