\chapter{Metering and Billing of Energy on Ethereum}\label{ch:implementation}

Smart contracts can transform the energy industry. In this chapter we explore the inefficiencies of the energy market and identify gaps which can be filled by blockchain. We go through the advantages of an energy-based application built on smart contracts. Finally, we describe the business logic of a specific energy use-case which we implemented on Ethereum. The implementation takes into account the methods and concepts described in Chapter \ref{ch:scalability} and Chapter \ref{ch:security} in order to ensure that the smart contracts are efficient and robust.


\section{Energy Market inefficiencies}

The global energy market is gradually transitioning to clean and renewable energy. Regulations encourage the usage of distributed energy resources (DERs) \cite{europe2030}. With the integration of DERs, consumers are gradually transforming to \textit{prosumers} who store their energy surplus or sell it to their peers, effectively decentralizing the generation of energy, contrary to existing power systems which were designed to accommodate central points of energy generation.

There are numerous inefficiencies which need to be resolved in today's energy markets~\cite{ey-inefficiencies}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Transaction complexity:} The complexity of energy transactions is correlated to the size of the network participants
    \item \textbf{Predictability and Reliability:} Availability of DERs is less predictable compared to traditional energy resources
    \item \textbf{Empowered prosumer:} Monitoring tools and infrastructure does not allow prosumers to manage their energy production and consumption sufficiently
    \item \textbf{Geographic mismatches:} Locations that fully utilize DERs are usually far from key points of energy demand. Transmitting energy over long distances is inefficient
    \item \textbf{Trust and Security:} New participants will only choose the system if it is able to be trusted and is properly secured
\end{enumerate}

\section{Energy Market use-cases for Blockchain}

A number of use-cases for smart contracts have been identified in the energy market. We proceed to describe applications that derive from the advantages of blockchain (transparency, trustlessness, security) as discussed in Section~\ref{advantages}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Supply chain tracking and logistics:} This is a broad blockchain use case which allows for optimization on logistics and tracking the location of products, reducing fraud and ensuring the validity of an event
    \item \textbf{Energy metering and billing:} By committing the values of energy consumed by entities to a blockchain, a timestamped record of meter readings gets generated which allows for the verification and more clear understanding of energy consumption across resources. This can be augmented to provide billing functionality (further described in \ref{business-logic})
    \item \textbf{Peer to Peer (P2P) energy trading:} Consumers and prosumers operate in a local microgrid and trade energy between them, without a centralized operator, resulting in reduced loss of energy during transportation
    \item \textbf{P2P Energy Micropayments:} Micropayments can occur when there are short term coincident of wants, such as in the case of charging a car in a traffic light stop from the energy surplus of another car. The supplier is expected to receive a micropayment for the energy they supplied. Using a blockchain for the payment is more efficient than a centralized payment provider due to speed of confirmation and low transaction costs
\end{enumerate}

\section{Business Logic} \label{business-logic}

In collaboration with Honda R\&D Germany, we create a pilot suite of smart contracts for in-house use in order to track and bill the consumed energy of the company's headquarters as measured by a set of smart meters. 

We proceed to discuss the business logic of the use-case and then implement it. We utilize the Method 3 from Section \ref{method3} to optimize our smart contracts for gas efficiency, and utilize Slither from Section~\ref{slither} and the learned best-practices to ensure that the developed smart contracts are robust. 

\subsection{Metering of Energy} \label{metering}

% \paragraph{Smart Meters}

A \textit{Smart Meter} is an energy meter which logs its measured energy readings to a monitoring server. A smart contract must track each smart meter by a unique identifier and store its power readings, along with the corresponding time of measurement. Due to the meter not being able to \textit{ping}\footnote{Hereafter, refers to a kWh,timestamp tuple which gets stored in the blockchain.} its reading directly to the blockchain, we create a pipeline where the reading and timestamp of each meter is pulled from the monitoring server and then pushed to the blockchain. 

\input{figures/ch5/meters_monitoringserver.tex}

% \paragraph{Virtual Meters}

A \textit{Virtual Meter} is a group of \textit{Smart Meters}. The purpose of a Virtual Meter (VM) is to track the consumption of multiple Smart Meters across various rooms of a company building. The consumption of a VM is a function of the power consumptions of its associated smart meters. 

The function that describes each Virtual Meter is supplied from an internal partner and is considered to be known. An example function for calculating the consumption of a virtual meter can be seen in Equation \ref{eq:formula}. $VM$ is used for Virtual Meters, $ELT$ for Smart Meters and $F$ for constant factors.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:formula}
    VM01 = 2 * ELT01 + ELT02 + F1 * ELT03
\end{equation}

It is the case that this process could be done entirely on-chain, by creating a smart contract that manages virtual meters separately. This would require another smart contract for virtual meters, which would need to store the Meter IDs for each meter associated to the virtual meter, along with the formula that describes how the virtual meter consumption is calculated. This logic is unnecessarily complex to be performed on a smart contract directly. Instead, it is done off-chain on the client side, by pulling the readings of each smart meter, calculating the reading of the virtual meter, and then pushing the aggregated reading to the smart contract's storage, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:virtual_meters_consumption}.

\subsection{Accounting Logic} \label{billing}

The accounting business logic of the company breaks down in a hierarchy which is described by \textit{Business Units} (BUs) and \textit{Departments}. BUs are used for external accounting, while Departments are used for internal accounting. In implementation terms, a Business Unit is equivalent to a Department.
 
A \textit{Department} is composed of \textit{Virtual Meters}, other Departments of a lower tier (hereafter called \textit{Subdepartments}) and \textit{Delegates}. A Department may forward its power consumption to its Delegates as part of the internal accounting process. The total consumption of a department is the sum of energy consumed by its Virtual Meters, Subdepartments and Delegates. After a department delegates its debt, its consumption is cleared.

There are two ways for a department to forward its consumption to its delegates:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Headcount Split:} A department can perform a headcount split of its consumption based on the percentage of staff that works at each of its \textit{Delegate} department.
    \item \textbf{Fixed Split:} A department with exactly two \textit{Delegates} can perform a fixed split of its consumption, where thefirst delegate receives $X\%$ of the department's consumption and the second delegate receives $(100-X)\%$.
\end{enumerate}

\input{figures/ch5/hierarchy.tex} % TODO: BETTER FIGURE

As an example, in \ref{fig:hierarchy}, BU2 performs a fixed split and forwards its consumption to its 2 delegates, Department 1.1 and Department 1.2. After delegation, the consumption of Business Unit 2 is cleared and is not calculated towards the total Energy Billing.

\section{Smart Contracts} \label{ch:implementation:sc}
In this section we go over the implementation and the rationale of each developed smart contract. We explain the inner workings and provide tests of their functionality. We follow the design principle that the data stored on the blockchain is the minimal amount of data that needs to be trustlessly verified. Any piece of data that can be derived from the already on-chain data is generated and verified off-chain. In case data does not need to be accessed by another contract but must be transmitted to an end-user, a Solidity \texttt{Event} is emitted (explained in \ref{apx:implementation:events}). It is considered that selected functions of each smart contract must be only used by selected operators, and thus they must be protected by an access control mechanism.

\subsection{MeterDB}
MeterDB utilizes Method 3 (\ref{method3}) to keep track of the energy consumption values and logged timestamps of a smart meter or a virtual meter. We assume that a meter can be any IoT device that has its own Ethereum account\footnote{As a prerequisite, a private-public keypair needs to be generated for every meter.}. The contract is designed to map each Meter's address to its details (\texttt{id}, \texttt{lastPower}, \texttt{lastTimestamp}, \texttt{power}, \texttt{timestamp}).

The contract is split in two files, \texttt{MeterDB.sol} which contains the business logic, and \texttt{Meter.sol} which contains the gas optimization logic that encodes and decodes meter data in a \texttt{bytes32} variable. In order for a meter to be able to call the \texttt{ping} function it first needs to be activated, by registering its id and address in the smart contract through the \texttt{activateMeter} function. Deactivating a decommissioned meter results in its data being deleted from the storage of the smart contract, which refunds gas as explained in Chapter \ref{ch:scalability}. This is done through \texttt{deactivateMeter}. We additionally store a mapping of \texttt{id}s to addresses to access a meter in $O(1)$ time instead of iterating over a list of registered meters and checking if the \texttt{id} is matched.

For each meter, its latest reading is pulled from the monitoring server and if a new consumption value has arrived it replaces the previous reading along with its timestamp by calling \texttt{ping}. A \texttt{Pinged} event is emitted after each \texttt{ping} function call which enables users to fetch the full history of readings and timestamps for a meter. Table~\ref{table:meter} illustrates the design of the storage in \texttt{Meter.sol}. A timestamp is made to count up to $2^{32}$ which is big enough to handle time values until the year 2106. Power readings can be up to $2^{48}$ which allows meter values up to multiple terawatthours, with milliwatthour granularity.

\input{tables/meter.tex}

\subsection{AccountingDB}

AccountingDB stores the data required to performing metering and billing for a department. Each department's data is broken down in department data and its accounting data. Storing department data involves using Method 3 (\ref{method3}) to store the consumption of each department, the headcount and activity status of the department and is done in \texttt{Department.sol}. 

Due to the forwarding of a department consumption to another, we keep track of the power that is generated by the virtual meters, the delegated power that is received from another department, and the cleared power which is the amount of power that has been cleared from that department, either through delegation or from an accountant. The consumption forwarding logic is implemented as described in Section~\ref{billing}. 

Departments are activated through \texttt{activateDepartment} and deactivated through \texttt{deactivateDepartment} and the headcount is set through \texttt{setHeadcount}. For each department, the list of Virtual Meters, Subdepartments and Delegates is stored in a \texttt{struct}, via the methods \texttt{setDelegates}, \texttt{setSubdepartments}, and \texttt{setVirtualMeters}. Finally, the billing of energy for a department is done through \texttt{billPower}, clearing is done through \texttt{clearDepartment} and forwarding a department's consumption is done through \texttt{headcountSplit} and \texttt{fixedSplit}.

\input{tables/department.tex}

\subsection{Contract Registry} 

In order to be able to retrieve the addresses of smart contracts by name, a \texttt{Registry} smart contract was implemented. The contract resolves contract names to addresses through a \texttt{bytes32} to \texttt{address} mapping. The address of a contract can be changed by the registry operator. This lays the foundation of a basic pattern for upgradeable smart contracts via a controlled name registry. Exploring the possible implementations of upgradeable contracts with this method is considered out of scope for this Thesis. Finally, this method can be utilized in the client scripts in Section \ref{ch:implementation:client} to reduce the number of addresses that need to be supplied to interact with the smart contracts\footnote{The registry's address is provided from the command line and then the registry resolves each contract's address by their names which are known beforehand}.

\subsection{Access Control} \label{acl}
As discussed in Chapter \ref{ch:security} enforcing proper access control on critical functions of a smart contract is very important. It is common to find Access Control Lists (ACL) in enterprise environments which allow participants to access selected resources based on their clearance levels. This functionality does not exist by default in smart contracts. Access control can be done separately in each contract, by implementing whitelists and checking that a sender of a transaction is whitelisted, however that needs to be done for each contract and does not scale for a rich smart contract ecosystem (further explained in \ref{apx:implementation:acl}). 

We use a pattern for access control that involves calling an external smart contract that stores the permissioning logic. We proceed to describe the access control enforced on each of the identified roles involved in the developed smart contracts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Administrator: Can call all functions in all deployed contracts.
    \item Registry Operator: Can call \texttt{enable} and \texttt{disable} in \texttt{Registry}.
    \item Meter Operator: Can call \texttt{activateMeter} and \texttt{deactivateMeter} in \texttt{MeterDB}.
    \item Accounting Operator: Can call \texttt{activateDepartment}, \texttt{deactivateDepartment}, \texttt{setDelegates}, \texttt{setVirtualMeters}, \texttt{setSubdepartments}, \texttt{setHeadcount} in \texttt{AccountingDB}.
    \item Accountant: Can call \texttt{billPower}, \texttt{fixedSplit}, \texttt{headcountSplit} and \texttt{clearDepartment} in \texttt{AccountingDB}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Deployment Pipeline}

The full deployment pipeline involves deploying each contract separately and linking it to the Access Control List as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}. At each step, the Administrator grants permissions to call specific functions of the smart contract to each role. Finally, after all contracts have been initialized, their addresses are stored in the Registry for later resolving.


\input{figures/ch5/pipeline.tex}

\section{Client Side} \label{ch:implementation:client}

As described in Section \ref{ch:basics:insideevm}, smart contract functions get executed only in response to transactions made by EOAs\footnote{Externally Owned Accounts, as described in Section \ref{ch:basics:insideevm}}. Since the goal is to have an automated process of pulling data from and pushing data to the smart contracts, we implement client scripts which perform that functionality. We use Python and Web3.py to implement utilities and multiple command line interfaces (CLIs) which are used to interact with the smart contracts. A module is also developed for interacting with the REST API of the monitoring server. A separate keypair is generated for every role mentioned in Section \ref{acl}, and each CLI is designed to function only with by using the corresponding role's private key.

\subsection{Utilities} \label{utils}

\subsubsection*{Web3.py and Contract Wrappers}
We created a wrapper around the web3 library in order to provide a generic interface when connecting to a node. That way, a web3 instance can be obtained by calling \texttt{getWeb3(endpoint)}, where \texttt{endpoint} is the Ethereum node IP and RPC port. Generally, in order to send a transaction, it must first be signed with the sender's private key. When a user hosts their own node, they can store their private key encrypted on the node and unlock the account when they want to send a transaction. In the case where multiple clients need to connect to a third-party node, there is a need to be able to send transactions that are already signed, without having to expose the private keys to the node.

We define a base class called \texttt{Contract} that provides functionality for interacting  with a smart contract. It allows signing transactions locally and broadcasting them to an Ethereum node. It is able to track the nonce of an account which means that an account can submit multiple transactions without waiting for the previous one to get confirmed. During initialization, it receives the ABI and address of the corresponding contract, along with a private key for signing the transactions. The exposed function \texttt{sign\_and\_send} is used to specify which function of the contract to call and submit it for execution to an Ethereum node. We use the \texttt{Contract} class throughout our implementation to create user-friendly interfaces for the functions of each contract while maximizing code reusability and security by signing transactions locally.

\subsubsection*{Monitoring Server and Rest API}
As mentioned in Section \ref{metering}, there is no direct access to each meter's reading, which forces us to access all readings through a REST API. We implemented a module which gets instantiated with a Meter id as a parameter, and is able to interact with the monitoring server API. The primary function used is \texttt{get\_single\_reading} which fetches 1 reading from the monitoring server (by default the most recent one). Implementing the whole set of functionality provided from the API was considered out of scope becaues it did not provide any additional information for our use-case.

\subsection{Administrator CLI}
The administrator role is used to grant or revoke role permissions to operators. The CLI interacts with the ACL smart contract which has been initialized as described in Section \ref{acl}.  As input, it expects an action (grant, revoke) and a json configuration file with the address of each account and its corresponding role to be granted or revoked. If no configuration file is supplied, it is expected that a role and address are provided as command line arguments. A user can additionally supply the \texttt{fund} parameter to send ether for the gas costs the operators will incur for interacting with their corresponding smart contracts. 

\subsection{Registry Operator CLI}
The registry operator's role is used to enable or disable a contract in the \texttt{Registry} contract. It can be utilized to register a new contract name and address at a later point in time or to remove an existing contract from the listing. The CLI also provides the functionality to resolve a contract name to its address or a contract address to its name. 

\subsection{Meter Operator CLI} \label{meter-operator}
The meter operator role is used to activate or deactivate smart meters in the \texttt{MeterDB} contract. A meter can only call the \texttt{ping} function only if it is activated by the operator. The CLI expects as input a json configuration file with the address of each meter and its id. If no configuration file is supplied, it is expected that an address and a meter id are provided as command line arguments. If the \texttt{deactivate} parameter is given, the CLI tries to deactivate the meters in the list that are already activated. The operator can additionally supply the \texttt{fund} parameter to send ether for the gas costs the meters will incur for calling \texttt{ping}.

\subsection{Accounting Operator CLI}
The accounting operator role is used to activate or deactivate departments in the \texttt{AccountingDB} contract. After activation, the operator sets each department's headcount, virtual meters, subdepartments and delegates according to the business logic supplied in a json configuration file that must be supplied as a command line argument.

\subsection{Single and Multiple Meters CLI}

A \texttt{meter} module is implemented which is responsible for connecting to \texttt{MeterDB} and the monitoring server API as explained in Section \ref{utils}. The meter first needs to be activated by the meter operator as explained in Section \ref{meter-operator}. The client is responsible for polling the monitoring server and ping any new power readings to the smart contract. The \texttt{single-meter} CLI expects the meter's private key as input, and retrieves the meter id from the smart contract in order to connect to the monitoring server. A frequency parameter can also be supplied to set how often a meter will poll the monitoring server for new data. This process runs in an infinite loop, or it can be modified to run as a cronjob.

Due to having multiple smart meters in our use-case, a \texttt{multiple-meters} CLI is also implemented which is responsible for launching multiple \texttt{single-meter} processes, each one running independently of each other. The output of each process is saved in a log file. 

\subsection{Single and Multiple Virtual Meters CLI}

A \texttt{virtualMeter} module is implemented which is responsible for connecting to \texttt{MeterDB} and pulling the reading of its connected meters as described in Section \ref{metering}. Along with the virtual meter's private key, a function is supplied to the CLI as arguments which specifies how the Virtual Meter consumption is calculated from its associated meters. The virtual meter and the meters included in the formula must be previously activated by the meter operator. Given the formula, each referenced meter's readings are fetched, and the formula is evaluated\footnote{Using the module: \url{https://github.com/Axiacore/py-expression-eval}} before pinging the final value to the smart contract. The process runs in an infinite loop, and can be modified to run as a cronjob.

Similarly to normal smart meters, a \texttt{multiple-virtualmeters} CLI is implemented which is responsible for launching multiple \texttt{single-virtualmeter} processes, each one running independently of each other. The output of each process is saved in a log file.

\subsection{Accountant CLI}
The accountant module is responsible for pulling all the readings associated with a department, calculating the total amount of energy to be billed to the department as well as performing any forwarding of energy to a department's delegates. The accountant is simultaneously connecting to \texttt{MeterDB} and \texttt{AccountingDB}. Even though the accountant role is not authorized to access the functions related to pinging or operating in \texttt{MeterDB}, accessing the data for each meter can be done without supplying the contract instance with a private key\footnote{Viewing data stored in a smart contract is free as it involves directly querying the node for its storage and does not involve any state mutating transaction. As a result, no private key is needed to access the meter readings.} 

The departments are processed in order from the inner-most tiers towards the top level departments, as described in Section~\ref{billing}. The flowchart in Figure \ref{fig:consumption_flowchart} shows the process that each department goes through in order to correctly calculate its final consumption.

\input{figures/ch5/flowchart.tex}

\subsection{Execution Pipeline} \label{execution}

Having described how each module of the client side works, in Figure \ref{fig:execution} we show the order in which the client side programs get executed to provide the desired metering and billing functionality. Firstly, the administrator grants all of the needed privileges to the corresponding operators' addresses. Then, the meter operator activates all meters, and all virtual meters. The accounting operator activates and initializes the accounting settings for each department. Each meter and virtual meter starts pushing their values asynchronously to the \texttt{MeterDB} contract, while at the same time the accountant is able to bill each department according to the logic which was previously specified by the accounting operator.

\input{figures/ch5/execution.tex}
