\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Research Questions}
We aim to answer the following research questions in this thesis:

\begin{enumerate}\label{statement}
    \item How can the scalability of smart contracts be improved?
    \item How can the security of smart contracts be improved?
    \item How can a system that is able to measure and bill the energy consumed by a set of energy meters be modeled? The system must be able to perform accounting on the measured energy based on a pre-specified accounting model. The system must be transparent, decentralized, and secure. Anyone in the network should be able to verify the validity transactions. Finally, the system needs to scalable at reasonable cost.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Scope}
The Master Thesis explores the fundamental terms needed to understand blockchain terminology. The contributions to scalability are limited to optimizing smart contracts. Other scalability solutions are mentioned but in depth analysis is considered out of scope. On security we limit ourselves to the industry's best practices, as per the literature and utilize a tool provided by an auditing firm. The architecture of the metering and billing model of energy consumed by the set of energy meters mentioned in \ref{statement} is implemented based on a specific use-case set by Honda Research and Development Germany, hereafter referred to as HREG, with which we collaborate for the purpose of the Master Thesis.

The technology used includes but is not limited to the Solidity programming language\footnote{Ethereum's most popular language for writing smart contracts}, the Truffle Framework for streamlining the compilation, testing and deployment process, Javascript for unit testing the smart contracts and the Python programming language for automating tasks, performing plotting and analyzing of data.


\section{Outline}

In Chapter~\ref{ch:basics} introduces terminology required for understanding blockchain fundamentals. We then proceed to explain how Ethereum works at a lower level, along with the programming techniques and tooling necessary to author smart contracts.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:scalability} we refer to the scalability issues that plague today's blockchain systems and provide a brief description of the known possible solutions that can be implemented to solve these problems. We make a contribution on scaling smart contracts which allows for more optimized writes to the Ethereum blockchain.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:security} we go over the most significant security issues found in Ethereum and its smart contracts. Having understood these, we evaluate and augment the auditing tool \textit{Slither}'s ability to detect and identify vulnerabilities and compare it to taxonomy of tools described in \cite{tools}. Finally, we analyze smart contracts \textit{honeypots} as a technique used by adversaries to profit from existing and well known smart contract flaws.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:implementation} we present ways in which smart contracts can address the energy market's inefficiencies and create a suite of smart contracts which are able to answer research question 3 from~\ref{statement}, while taking the lessons learned from~\ref{ch:scalability} and~\ref{ch:security} into account.

In Chapter~\ref{ch:results} we evaluate the performance and the extent at which the smart contracts from Chapter \ref{ch:implementation} achieve their goal. 

In Chapter~\ref{ch:conclusion} we reiterate and summarize on the findings from the previous chapters, highlight future work that can be done to further improve both the design of the described smart contracts but also the security and scalability of Ethereum.

\section{Writing Conventions}
A glossary can be found at the end of the document for all terminology used (written in italics). Limited code snippets can be found across the document when needed for explanatory reasons, full code with explanations can be found in the Appendices and in the accompanying GitHub URL\@. Minimal parts of Chapter \ref{ch:implementation} are redacted due to the inclusion of intellectual property of HREG.
