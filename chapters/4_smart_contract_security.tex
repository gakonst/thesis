\chapter{Smart Contract Security}
Smart contracts immutable, lack of tooling, and developer mistakes

\section{Past Vulnerabilities}
Past vulnerabilities had lots of money locked, business logic of application broken. Brief summary of some vulns. Refer to relevant literature for more in depth.

Online platforms for training and exploiting have been developed.

\section{Security of deployed Smart Contracts}
Talk about the literature which has already mapped through the deployed contracts. 
Which tools did they use? Oyente, Mythril etc

\section{Best Practices}
Contract oriented, keep it simple, no tx.origin, ktl as described in literature


\section{Access Control}
There is NO private data, just functions that can be called by certain individuals
A proper access control model needs to be implemented so that only authorized users can access certain functions.
